### What I learned

My first deep dive into using Tailwind CSS on a project. I learned about using gradients, abitrary values, pseudo-class modifications, responsive modifiers, and theme customization in Tailwind CSS. Excited to dig deeper with the next challenge.

### Continued development

This was a great starting point for working with Tailwind CSS, and I'm starting to understand what all the fuss is about. I plan to continue using Tailwind CSS for Frontend Mentor challenges moving forward.

### Useful resources
